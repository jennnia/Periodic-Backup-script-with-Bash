# Periodic-Backup-script-with-Bash

ðŸŒŸ This Bash script creates periodic backups of a specified directory. It accepts a directory path as a command-line argument and generates a compressed .zip archive of the directory every 5 seconds. Each backup file is named with a timestamp to ensure uniqueness, following the format backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.zip. The script runs in an infinite loop, continuously creating backups until manually stopped. This is useful for automating backup tasks where frequent snapshots of a directory are required.
